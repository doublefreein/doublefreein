Ethical technology refers to software that is created and distributed with a strong focus on ethical principles and values.

1. It respects users' privacy and values user data:
   * Ethical solutions often respect user privacy by collecting minimal data and providing transparent data handling practices.
2. Accessible to all:
   * They aim to be inclusive and accessible to people across different languages and cultures.
3. Environmentally conscious:
   * It takes into account the environmental impact of software development and seeks to minimize its carbon footprint.
4. Transparent:
   * In software development, ethical practices are often open and transparent, allowing users to inspect the code and understand how the software works.
5. Long-life:
   * Ethical solutions often last long because they are carefully designed.

Many popular solutions and companies today do not adhere to these principles. This is not solely due to resource and time constraints but also because of pressure from investors, a lack of awareness, and the ongoing drive for shorter development cycles.

[Doublefree](https://doublefree.in) will prioritize ethical development above all else. Our commitment to copyleft and open source development enables us to deliver ethical solutions.

Copyleft is a specific approach to licensing software that is aligned with the principles of ethical software development. Copyleft licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL), ensure that software remains free and open source by requiring that any derivative works are also licensed under the same terms. In essence, copyleft licenses enforce the principles of software freedom by preventing the creation of proprietary versions of the software.
