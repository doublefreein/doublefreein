* Educational & Awareness Initiatives:
1. We assist schools in introducing GNU/Linux operating systems to raise awareness among children about alternatives to proprietary operating systems.
2. We organize seminars and talks on the subject of Free & Open Source Software (FOSS).
3. We help schools in hosting and maintaining their secure websites, similar to this, at a fraction of the cost of conventional website hosting and maintenance.
